All of Upstart’s personal loans are unsecured, so there’s no collateral. Loans originated through Upstart can be used for a wide range of purposes, including:

Financing a dream wedding
Renovating your kitchen or bathroom 
Consolidating credit card debt
Paying for elective medical procedures
Moving to another state

Lenders usually prohibit borrowers from using personal loans for education expenses or student loan repayment. But Upstart allows borrowers to use its personal loans to pay for college tuition or certificate programs, and you can even use the loan to pay off your student loan debt.
